# Codelab Compose State
This is a code lab about Jetpack Compose in Kotlin from the Android Developers website. I developed an app to track the consumed amount of glasses and add simple tasks using Compose. I've also implemented some kind of ViewModel in the app to make it more correct in terms of the app architecture.
